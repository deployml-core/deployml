# Contributing to deployml

We welcome contributors who are interested in helping with issues/bugs and expanding and improving upon what has already been built. Please note that since this is an academic project that is supervised by one faculty member, and maintained by students, it is not always possible to respond promptly to messages.

## Issues

Questions, feature requests and bug reports are all welcome as [discussions or issues](https://github.com/deployml-core/deployml/issues).

## Pull Requests

Please create an issue to discuss your changes before creating a pull request.
